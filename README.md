# Open Up The Cloud - Cloud Bootcamp

A repository of exercises for learning about the cloud (uses [Gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io/))

## Getting Started

### 1. Open in Gitpod

It's [free up to 50 hours a month](https://www.gitpod.io/pricing), which should be enough to get you started.

Just click below ðŸ‘‡ 

<a href="https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/openupthecloud/cloud-bootcamp"><img src="https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg"/></a>

**Note:** You don't _have_ to do this step, you can also configure your local environment according to the [Dockerfile](./.gitpod.Dockerfile) and [Gitpod YAML](./.gitpod.yml). Using Gitpod avoids understanding all of that as a beginner, though. Also, consider installing [the Gitpod browser extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension/).

### 2. Add your access key & secret

When the workspace opens, you'll be prompted for your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

Which will be added to [your Gitpod environment variables](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/environment-variables)

**Note:** Remember to replace the access key and secret with your actual ones. 

### 3. You're All Set ! ðŸš€

* Login to your AWS account (if you setup aws-vault): `aws-vault login default --backend=file`
* Check you have the right AWS credentials configured: `aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text` will show your AWS account ID.
* Check your current environment variables with: `env | grep AWS`
* Try the following command to make an S3 bucket (note: each call makes a new bucket) `BUCKET=s3://open-up-the-cloud-test-bucket"$(date +%s)" && aws s3 mb "$BUCKET" && aws s3 ls` 

## What if I don't have an AWS account?

For cloud access, I highly recommend using the [A Cloud Guru playgrounds](https://acloudguru.com/platform/cloud-sandbox-playgrounds) so that: 

1. You don't have to deal with deleting resources
2. Never get landed with an outsized bill

If you choose to create your own AWS account, be sure to follow best-practices such as: setting up a billing alarm, etc. Using A Cloud Guru gets around this complexity, but it's your choice. 

### Something broken? 

If you find something broken in this repo, if you can fix it, I'd really appreciate if you could raise a PR! ðŸš€
