# Open Up The Cloud - Cloud Bootcamp

A repository of exercises for learning about the cloud, using [Gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io/).

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/openupthecloud/cloud-bootcamp)

## Setup 

1. Open in Gitpod

<a href="https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/openupthecloud/cloud-bootcamp"><img src="https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg"/></a>

2. Add `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` to [your environment variables](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/environment-variables)

Within Gitpod workspace, you can simply execute: `gp env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key`

3. Add `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to [your environment variables](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/environment-variables)

Within Gitpod workspace, you can simply execute: `gp env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key`

## Cloud Access

For cloud access, I highly recommend using the [A Cloud Guru playgrounds](https://acloudguru.com/platform/cloud-sandbox-playgrounds) so that: 

1. You don't have to deal with deleting resources
2. Never get landed with an outsized bill

## Disclaimer

Please execute any of the scripts found in this application with caution, be sure to delete any unnecessary resources after creation.
