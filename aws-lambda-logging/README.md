##Â Lambda Logging

This exercise runs you through how to experiment with AWS Lambda logging on AWS, using AWS SAM to deploy our application. 

### Getting Started

* [cd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)) into this directory: `cd aws-lambda-logging`
* Run [`sam deploy --guided`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-deploy.html) to walk through and configure the SAM steps and create the underlying SAM resources required. 
* To re-build and deploy: `sam build && sam deploy`
* To invoke lambda 10 times: `for i in {1..20}; do aws lambda invoke --function-name sam-app-HelloWorldFunction-wBFLqI9QEAv9 /dev/null; done`

## Exercise

1. Open the AWS Lambda in AWS, find the logs and start to look around
2. Experiment viewing the logs, and filtering them to find interesting correlations
3. Experiment by creating a dashboard based on your log findings
