##Â Lambda Logging

This exercise runs you through how to experiment with AWS Lambda logging on AWS, using AWS SAM to deploy our application. 

### Getting Started

* [cd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)) into this directory: `cd aws-lambda-logging`
* Run [`sam deploy --guided`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-deploy.html) to walk through and configure the SAM steps and create the underlying SAM resources required. 
* To re-build and deploy: `sam build && sam deploy`
